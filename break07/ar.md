## Augmented reality
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality):

> Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data ... As a result, the technology functions by enhancing oneâ€™s current perception of reality
