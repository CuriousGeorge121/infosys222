- Case study



## Data modelling
- Data modelling is the _process of creating a data model_ for a given set of data
	- conceptual â†’ logical â†’ physical

- How data are defined, structured and stored would have a _significant implication_ to how they can be accessed and manipulated

- ðŸ¤” What makes a good data model?

- During the stage of physical data modelling it is often necessary to consider the data modelâ€™s impact on the efficiency of database operations


## ER model

- The concept is originally defined by [Chen (1976)](https://auckland.rl.talis.com/items/B68EEFEE-FAA3-9B64-1576-47912B3F3053.html?referrer=%2Flists%2F67385800-22DC-21D5-CBF3-00CC4AFE9E1E.html%23item-B68EEFEE-FAA3-9B64-1576-47912B3F3053) which has been adopted and refined by practitioners as the leading method to carry out data modelling

- An ER model is a _systematic way_ of describing and defining a business process. The process is modelled as _entities_ that are linked with each other by _relationships_ that express the dependencies and requirements between them

- An ERD is used as a tool for ER modelling, which also provides a representation of the ER model

- <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Further: [ER model from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)


## Entity
- An __entity__ is an object (abstract or physical)
	- "Interstellar", "Matthew McConaughey"
	- "University of Auckland", "OGG Building"

- Entities are grouped into __entity set__ or entity type / class
	- Movie, Actor
	- University, Building

- An entity set is conventionally named with a singular noun
	- related to business characteristics, meaningful and self-documenting; unique and concise, readable

- ðŸ“¢ In ER modelling, sometimes an entity set is called an entity, whereas an entity is called an instance


## Relationship

- Two entity sets may be connected in some way. In the ER model this can be expressed as a __relationship__
	- The Movie and Actor entity sets are connected by actors starring in movies. For example, "Interstellar" is connected to "Matthew McConaughey"

- Degree
	- unary, binary, ternary, n-nary

- [Cardinality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)
	- Multiplicity: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
	- Optionality: optional or mandatory


## Conceptual ERD

## Degree and cardinality
![relationship](relationship.svg)  
<small>Figure 3.2: Unary and binary relationships with different cardinalities</small>


## Multiple relationships
![multiple](multiple.svg)
<small>Figure 3.3: Multiple relationships established among two entity sets</small>


## Attribute
- An __attribute__ is a property or a characteristic of an entity set (or a many-to-many relationship)
	- The entity set Actor might be given attributes name, address, gender and birthDate
	- Each entity in the entity set would have values associated with each attribute

- The value of attribute
	- atomic (single-valued) vs multivalued
	- stored vs derived


## Key
- In most cases, an entity can be uniquely identified in its entity set by the values of its attributes
	- A set of attributes whose values uniquely identify an entity in its entity set is called a __key__ or a __candidate key__
	- If there are several candidate keys, we choose one of them as the __primary key__, where its value must not change and must not be [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)

- Example: AUID could be chosen as the primary key for the Student entity set

# <i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i> Case study
### An art museum <!-- .slide: data-background="art.jpg" data-background-transition="zoom" -->


## Objective
- Read the specification carefully, then:

	- draw a conceptual ERD to represent the given case study

	- extend the conceptual ERD with attribute


## Specification
- An art museum owns a large volume of <span class="fragment highlight-green">works of art</span>. Each work of art is identified by an <span class="fragment highlight-red">item code</span>. Each work can be described using <span class="fragment highlight-red">a title, the size â€“ composed of height, width and weight</span>. A work of art <span class="fragment highlight-blue">is developed</span> by an <span class="fragment highlight-green">artist</span>. The artist of some works <span class="fragment highlight-blue">is not known</span>. An artist is identified by an <span class="fragment highlight-red">artist number</span> and described by <span class="fragment highlight-red">name, age, gender, dob and dod</span> (null for living artists!). <span class="fragment highlight-blue">Only data about artists for works currently owned by the museum</span> are kept in the database


## More specification
- At any time, an art work is either <span class="fragment highlight-blue">displayed</span> in the museum, <span class="fragment highlight-blue">held in storage</span>, away from the museum as part of a travelling <span class="fragment highlight-green">show</span>, or <span class="fragment highlight-blue">on loan</span> to another <span class="fragment highlight-green">gallery</span>. If on display the <span class="fragment highlight-green">location</span> of the display (in the museum) is noted. A travelling show is described by a <span class="fragment highlight-red">show ID, city</span> in which the show is currently appearing, and the <span class="fragment highlight-red">start and end dates</span> of the show. <span class="fragment highlight-blue">Many of the museum works</span> can be part of a given show. One art work can be displayed in <span class="fragment highlight-blue">many shows</span> over time. These need to be recorded for future analysis. A gallery is described by a <span class="fragment highlight-red">gallery identifier, name and city</span>. The museum wants to retain a history of all works of art loaned to another gallery. The <span class="fragment highlight-red">date loaned and the date returned</span> must be recorded and retained.


## The modelling process
- Entity set
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Artwork (__itemCode__, title, height, width, weight)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Artist (__artistNo__, name, gender, dob, dod)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Show (__showID__, city, startDate, endDate)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Gallery (__galleryID__, name, city)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Location (__locID__, locDesc)

- Relationship
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Artist develops Artwork (optional one to mandatory many)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Location displays Artwork (optional one to optional many)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Show stores Artwork (optional many to mandatory many)
	- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Gallery borrows Artwork (optional many to mandatory many) with loanDate and returnDate

## Conceptual to logical
- [Conceptual data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_schema)
	- a high-level description of the informational needs of a business
	- it describes the things of significance (entity sets), about which it is inclined to collect information, and characteristics of (attributes) and associations between pairs of those things of significance (relationships)

- [Logical data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_data_model)
	- a detailed representation of some or all of an organization's data, independent of any particular database management technology, and described in business language
	- the content is adjusted to achieve certain efficiencies


## Associative entity set
- In logical data modelling, one major task is to resolve __all__ many-to-many relationship in the conceptual data model by converting them to [__associative entity set__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_entity)

- ðŸ¤” Why is this step necessary?

- An associative entity set is used to represent a relationship which often has its own attribute that do not belong to other entity set

- Each many-to-many relationship would be resolved into two one-to-many relationships with an associative entity set


## Example
![emp_course](emp_course.svg)
<small>Figure 3.7: Resolving a binary many-to-many relationship into an associative entity set</small>


## Another example
![bom](bom.svg)
<small>Figure 3.8: Resolving an unary many-to-many relationship into an associative entity set</small>



## Quiz 01
- Draw a logical ERD to represent the following case

	- Each vendor can supply many parts to any number of warehouses but need not supply and parts
	- Each part can be supplied by any number of vendors to more than one warehouse, but each part must be supplied by at least one vendor to a warehouse
	- Each warehouse can be supplied with any number of parts from more than one vendor, but each warehouse must be supplied with at least one part



## Quiz 02
- Revisit the [art museum case study](#/4)

- Draw a logical ERD to represent the case study and list all assumptions made



## Quiz 03
- Modify the logical ERD of the [art museum case study](#/4) from [Quiz 02](#/7) to accommodate one additional requirement:

	- the museum would like to keep track of the history of displaying the works of art in different locations over time, with a start date and an end date recorded



## Existence dependency
- __Strong__ entity set
	- exists independent of other entity set
	- has its own unique identifier

- __Weak__ entity set
	- existence dependent on a strong entity set
	- does not have a unique identifier (only a partial identifier)

- The relationship between a strong entity set and a weak entity set is called an __identifying__ relationship, as opposed to __non-identifying__ relationship


## Strong and weak
